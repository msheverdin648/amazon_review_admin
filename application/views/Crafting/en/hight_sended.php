                    <p>Most valuable reviews for our community have 3 things in common:</p>
                    <ul class="check">
                        <li><b class="future">Write at least 2 sentences:</b> Short reviews that only say things like "I love it" or "I hate it" aren't very useful to other customers. Please write a couple of sentences explaining what you liked or disliked about the product.</li>
                        <li><b class="future">Include one or more images:</b> Yes, we know it's a clich√©, but a picture really is worth a thousand words. Even if it's just a quick photo shot using your phone, it can help other customers understand what they're buying and how the product looks like.</li>
                        <li><b class="future">Be honest:</b> We don't like fake, biased reviews. So most importantly please keep your review honest.</li>
